8 concept dichotomy analysis - all 35 permutations
    - we have 11-12 good concepts -- what to do with this?
        - all permutations of 8 concepts from 12? this gives us ~1000 plots though
        - start with ones we decided on
        considerations:
            - first generate list of all 35 permutations
            - decoding on dichotomy
                - pseudopopulations or not -- do both?
            - figure -- bar graph of x axis dichotomy number, y of decoding perf
                - metric roc auc for non-pseudopops?
        -

random thoughts:
can we find axis of good/bad -- and track characters across that axis over time
 -- main case would be the arab kid -- good at first but then bad 
 can we find the neural correlate of this? 
  -- do pca of obviously good/bad characters decoder axis, plot kumar points before and after
